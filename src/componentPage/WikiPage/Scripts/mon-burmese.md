# Mon-Burmese Scripts

[Mon-Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon%E2%80%93Burmese_script) refers to a collection of scripts used mainly in Burma/Myanmar to write languages such as [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet), [Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_alphabet), [Sgaw-Karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27gaw_Karen_alphabet), etc.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Mon-Burmese script developed from [the Pallava script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script). Thus, the script is connected with the [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script), [Grantha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantha_script), [Khmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script), [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_script), and [Kawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawi_script) scripts.

Mon-Burmese is an abugida that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units.

## Writing System
The Mon-Burmewse writing system consists of **independent consonants**, **independent vowels**, **dependent vowels**, **virama**, and **medials**.

* Independent consonants by default are followed by the "a" vowel. For example ဗက  by itself would be read as "baka", not "bak" nor "bk".
* Independent vowels are vowels that can stand by itself without relying on အ. It is used when writing a syllable that consists of only one vowel and no consonant. For example, ika would be written as ဣက.
* Dependent vowels are vowels that cannot stand on its own. Usually it is attached to a consonant or a vowel threshold (အ) in order to function. For example, bi would be written as ဗိ.
* Asat (်) is also called the vowel killer. This is used to kill vowels from syllables. For example when put on က it would kill the "a" sound making the sound just a regular k. For example ဗက (baka) when the virama is added becomes ဗကံ (bak).
* Medials are consonants that stand in the middle of a syllable. Usually it is used when forming word that has 2 consonants prior to a vowel. For example, thee r in tri is a medial.
