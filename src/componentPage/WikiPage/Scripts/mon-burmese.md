# Mon-Burmese Scripts

[Mon-Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon%E2%80%93Burmese_script) refers to a collection of scripts used mainly in Burma/Myanmar to write languages such as [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet), [Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_alphabet), [Sgaw-Karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27gaw_Karen_alphabet), etc.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Mon-Burmese script developed from [the Pallava script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script). Thus, connecting the script with the [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script), [Grantha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantha_script), [Khmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script), [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_script), and [Kawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawi_script) scripts.
The Mon-Burmese itself is an abugida which works by putting vowel signs on its independent consonants to form syllables, in contrast to the alphabets which put vowels as independent unit, such as the latin and greek derived ones.

## Writing System
The writing system consists of independent consonants, independent vowels, dependent vowels, virama, and medials.

* Independent consonants by default are followed by the "a" vowel. For example ဗက by itself would be read as baka, not bak or bk.
* Independent vowels are vowels that can stand by itself without relying on အ. It is used when writing a syllable that consists of only one vowel and no consonant. For example, ika would be written as ဣက.
* Dependent vowels are vowels that cannot stand on its own. Usually it is attached to a consonant or a vowel threshold (အ) in order to function. For example, bi would be written as ဗိ.
* Virama (ံ) is also called the vowel killer. This is used to kill vowels from syllables. For example when put on က it would kill the a sound making the sound just a regular k. For example ဗက (baka) when the virama is added becomes ဗကံ (bak).
* Medials are consonants that stand in the middle of a syllable. Usually it is used when forming word that has 2 consonants prior to a vowel. For example, thee r in tri is a medial.
