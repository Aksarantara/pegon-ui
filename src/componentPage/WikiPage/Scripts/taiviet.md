The [Tai Viet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Viet_script) or Tai-Dam script is a script used to write [  
Tai Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Dam_language "Tai Dam language"),  [Tai Daeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Daeng_language "Tai Daeng language"),  [Tai Dón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_D%C3%B3n_language "Tai Dón language"),  [Thai Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Song_language "Thai Song language")  and  [Tày Tac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A0y_Tac_language "Tày Tac language") languages.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Tai-Viet script developed from [the Sukhothai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhothai_script "Sukhothai script") script. Thus, the script is connected with the [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script "Thai script") and [Fakkham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakkham_script "Fakkham script") scripts

Tai-Viet is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit.


## Writing System
The Tai-Viet writing system consists of **consonants**, **vowels**, and **tones**

* Consonants are followed by an inherent /o/ sound, unless it is followed by a vowel diacritics. There are by default two types of consonants, Consonants with high tones and low tones.
* All vowels in Tai-viet are

Traditionally, the script had no tone marks, and only indicated tones with the consonant variations of high/low variations. However in the 1970s, tone marks were introduced to the script. There are in total 6 tones. Tone 1 is marked with only a low consonant. Tone 2 is marked with the first tone mark and a low consonant form. Tone 3 is marked with the second tone mark and a low consonant form.Tone 4 is marked with only a high consonant. Tone 5 is marked with the first tone mark and a high consonant form. Tone 6 is marked with the second tone mark and a high consonant form. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Viet_script#Tones))
