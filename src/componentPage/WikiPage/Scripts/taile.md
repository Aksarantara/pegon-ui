# Tai Le Script

The [Tai Le](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Le_script) script is used to write [ Tai Nüa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_N%C3%BCa_language "Tai Nüa language"), [Ta'ang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaung_language "Palaung language"), [Blang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blang_language "Blang language"), and [Achang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achang_language "Achang language") languages.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Tai-Le script developed from [the Mon–Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon%E2%80%93Burmese_script "Mon–Burmese script") script. Thus, the script is connected with the [Ahom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahom_script "Ahom script") and [Khamti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamti_script "Khamti script") scripts

Tai-Le, although was born from an abugida, is actually used like an alphabet. Whereas in an **abugida** syllables are constructed by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants. Tai-Le, like other alphabetic scripts such as Latin and Greek, treats vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit. 


## Writing System
The Tai-Le writing system consists of **consonants**, **vowels**, **special vowels**, and **tones**


### Independent Consonants :

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin    | Buhid | Phonetic Reading (IPA) |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| k  | `x` |   ᥐ      | /k/ |
| x  | `x`      | ᥑ      | /x/ |
| ng | `n_g`     | ᥒ      | /ŋ/|
| ts | `t_s`      | ᥓ      | /t͡s/|
| s | `s`      | ᥔ      | /s/|
| y | `y`      | ᥕ      | /j/|
| t | `t`      | ᥖ      | /t/|
| th | `t_h`      | ᥗ      | /tʰ/|
| l | `l`      | ᥘ      | /l/|
| p | `p`      | ᥙ      | /p/|
| ph | `p_h`      | ᥚ      | /pʰ/|
| m | `m`      | ᥛ      | /m/|
| f | `f`      | ᥜ      | /f/|
| w | `w`      | ᥝ      | /w/|
| h | `h`      | ᥞ      | /h/|
| q | `q`      | ᥟ      | /ʔ/|
| kh | `k_h`      | ᥠ      | /kʰ/|
| tsh | `t_s_h`      | ᥡ      | /t͡sʰ/|
| n | `n`      | ᥢ      | /n/|


### Vowels :

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin | Buhid | IPA |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| a       | `a`       | ᥣ      | /a/ |
| i       | `i`      | ᥤ      | /i/|
| e        | `e`       | ᥥ      | /e/ |
| è        | `ee`       | ᥦ      | /ɛ/ or /ia/ |
| ə        | `^e`       | ᥫ      | /ə/ |
| u        | `u`       | ᥧ      | /u/ |
| o        | `o`       | ᥩ      | /o/ |
| ó        | `oo`       | ᥨ      | /ɔ/ or /ua/ |
| î        | `^u`       | ᥪ      | /ɯ/ |
| aî        | `a^u`       | ᥬ      | /aɯ/ |
| ai        | `ai`       | ᥭ      | /ai/ |

Special vowels are basically vowels that are a mix of two vowels to create a new sound. It's also known as special syllables in this case. 


### Dependent Vowels :

| Standard Latin | Reversible Latin | Buhid | IPA  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| i      | `i`      | ᝒ      | /i/ |
| u      | `u`       |  ᝓ       | /u/  |


## Examples

Here are some examples of Buhid script and its Latin counterpart :

* ᝃᝑ ᝓᝃᝑ  : kahu kahu
* ᝃ ᝓ ᝋᝎᝄ ᝓ : ku malagu
