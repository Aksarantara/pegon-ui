# Cham Script

The [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_script) script is one of the two scripts used to write the [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_language) language, the other one being the Jawi script.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Cham script was descended from the [Pallavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script) script. Therefore it is distantly connected to the [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script), [Khmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script), and many other scripts.

Cham is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit. 


## Writing System
The Buhid writing system consists of **independent consonants**, **independent vowels**, and **dependent vowels**

* Independent consonants by default are followed by the "a" vowel. For example ᝇ  by itself would be read as "da".
* Independent vowels are vowels that can stand by itself. It is used when writing a syllable that consists of only one vowel and no consonant. For example, "*ika*" would be written as ᝁᝃ.
* Dependent vowels are vowels that cannot stand on its own. Usually it is attached to a consonant in order to function. For example, bi would be written as ᝋᝒ.

### Independent Consonants :

## Examples

Here are some examples of Buhid script and its Latin counterpart :

* ᝃᝑ ᝓᝃᝑ  : kahu kahu
* ᝃ ᝓ ᝋᝎᝄ ᝓ : ku malagu
