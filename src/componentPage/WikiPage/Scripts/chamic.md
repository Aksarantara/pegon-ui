# Cham Script

The [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_script) script is one of the two scripts used to write the [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_language) language, the other one being the Jawi script.


## Relation to Other Scripts

The Cham script was descended from the [Pallavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script) script. Therefore it is distantly connected to the [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script), [Khmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script), and many other scripts.

Cham is an **abugida** that constructs syllables by affixing vowel signs to its independent consonants, differing from alphabetic scripts like Latin and Greek that treat vowels as distinct units. What this means is that there are no letters representing consonants or vowels on their own--each letter represents a syllable unit. 


## Writing System
The Cham writing system consists of **independent consonants**, **medial consonants**, **final consonants**, **independent vowels**, and **dependent vowels**

* Independent consonants by default are followed by the "a" vowel. For example ꨆ  by itself would be read as "ka".
* Medial consonants are consonants that are placed in between another consonant and a vowel to form a consonant cluster. For example, ꨆꨴ would be read as kra and not kara, as it uses the medial ra, therefore it also silences the previous ka.
* Final consonants are consonants that are placed usually at the end of a word as virama (vowel killer) does not exist in this script. There are in general two types of final consonants, letters and diacritics. Final consonants in the form of a diacritic are usually used on loan words, while native words use the letter form.
* Independent vowels are vowels that can stand by itself. It is used when writing a syllable that consists of only one vowel and no consonant. For example, "*ika*" would be written as ꨁꨆ.
* Dependent vowels are vowels that cannot stand on its own. Usually it is attached to a consonant in order to function. For example, bi would be written as ꨝꨪ.
